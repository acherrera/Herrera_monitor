# Herrera monitor

These are just some changes that I made to the Seamod monitor. Major changes
include

* Changing internet device to enpo230 instead of eth0
* Removing all but one disk usage
* changing all graph colors to green gradients
* Removing all but the memory and CPU cirle bar indicators
* Location adjustments for the above
